      "full": "Rusalki are female water spirits from Slavic folklore, believed to be the restless souls of women who died by drowning—whether through suicide, murder, or as unbaptized maidens. Characterized by their ethereal beauty, long green hair like water plants, and deathly pale skin, they inhabit rivers, lakes, and ponds throughout Slavic lands. During Rusalka Week (Rusalnaya, the week before Pentecost in late spring), these spirits leave the water to dance in forests and fields. They lure men with their beauty and enchanting songs, then either tickle them to death or drown them in their watery domains. Some traditions portray them as purely malevolent spirits of vengeance, while others suggest they can be helpful or protective under certain circumstances. Unlike Western mermaids, rusalki have legs and can walk on land, making them particularly dangerous during their seasonal emergence from the water."
