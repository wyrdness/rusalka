      "full": "Rusalki are female water spirits from Slavic folklore, believed to be the restless souls of women who died by drowning, whether through suicide, murder, or as unbaptized maidens. Characterized by their ethereal beauty, long green hair, and pale skin, they inhabit rivers, lakes, and ponds. During Rusalka Week (Rusalnaya), they leave the water to dance in forests and fields. They lure men with their beauty and enchanting songs, then tickle them to death or drown them. Some traditions portray them as purely malevolent, while others suggest they can be helpful or protective under certain circumstances."
